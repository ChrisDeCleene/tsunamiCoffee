# Chris DeCleene's HTML/CSS Cheatsheet
> The focus of this project was to turn this website into a mobile responsive website. The use of media queries and responsive CSS creates a seemless look on all devices. I built this as part of the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). Please share any feedback regarding this project! Happy coding!
